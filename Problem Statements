Problem Statement 1:

---Suggested Deliverables Outline:

1. Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Sections to include:

Introduction: Context & scope (scanning container images for vulnerabilities).

User Stories:

As a user, I want to see a list of scanned images with vulnerability status.

As a user, I want to filter images by severity level.

As a user, I want to get remediation guidance for vulnerabilities.


Functional Requirements:

Dashboard showing summary of scanned images.

Filters by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low).

Search and pagination for large repositories.

Detailed view for each image: list of vulnerabilities, severity, fix suggestions.


Non-Functional Requirements:

Scalability for thousands of images.

Responsive and intuitive UI.

Security and access control.


Acceptance Criteria:

Users can find all critical/high vulnerabilities in < 2 clicks.

Scans update regularly or on demand.



2. Low-Fidelity Wireframes
Screens to sketch:

Dashboard:

Summary cards: Total Images, Images with Critical Vulns, Images with High Vulns.

Graph/Chart for quick severity breakdown.


Images List Page:

Table with: Image Name, Vulnerability Count, Most Severe Level, Last Scan Date.

Filters: Severity, Date Range, Image Name Search.


Image Detail Page:

Image Metadata.

List of vulnerabilities with severity, description, fix instructions.

Action buttons: Rescan, Export Report.



3. (Optional) Development Action Items

Integrate with container registries (e.g., Docker Hub, private registries).

Implement vulnerability scanning engine (e.g., using open-source tools like Clair, Trivy).

Design backend APIs for scan results.

Implement frontend views matching wireframes.

Add user authentication and role-based access control.
